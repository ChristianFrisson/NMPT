Installation</a></h2>
<p>The NMPT package can be downloaded from the <a class="el" href="obtaining__page.html#obtaining_sec">Download NMPT</a> page. It is structured as a development source tree. At the top level (the NMPT directory) there is a single Makefile, and below are several directories: bin, build, data, doc, src.</p>
<p>It is meant to stand alone under any standard C++ compiler, with the exception that it requires the OpenCV libraries. The only platform-specific (or user specific) portion of the compilation should be correctly locating the OpenCV libraries on your system. A few standard configurations are supported, but porting the code to a new system is as simple as modifying the Makefile to reflect the location of the OpenCV header files (includes) and libraries.</p>
<p>To compile the code: </p>
<ul>
<li>Download and unzip the NMPT diectory (<a class="el" href="obtaining__page.html#obtaining_sec">Download NMPT</a>). </li>
<li>Download and install OpenCV in one of the listed ways (See <a class="el" href="install__page.html#opencv_sec">Installing OpenCV</a>). </li>
<li>Open the file called "Makefile" in the NMPT directory with a text editor. </li>
<li>Set the <code>PLATFORM</code> variable to the appropriate choice. The current supported options are <code>MACFRAMEWORK</code> (Mac OS X), <code>MACPORTS</code> (Mac OS X), <code>CYGWIN</code> (Windows), and <code>LINUX</code> (Linux). Each of these options is described further below. </li>
<li>From a terminal window, type "make" in the NMPT directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>On compilation, the binaries will be generated and placed in the "bin" subdirectory. Intermediate build files (e.g. .o object files) will be placed in the "build" subdirectory.</p>
<p>Once the Makefile has been properly configured, you can run a sample program by typing</p>
<p><code> &gt;&gt; make <br/>
 &gt;&gt; bin/FastSUN data/HDMovieClip.avi </code></p>
<p>For more information on the included <a class="el" href="group___m_p_group.html">Machine Perception Primitives</a> and the <a class="el" href="group___examples_group.html">Example Programs</a>, see below.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="opencv_sec">
Installing OpenCV</a></h2>
<p>OpenCV is a freely available and easy to use package for C++ computer vision applications. You will need to have access to its libraries to be able to use this software. Although it has not been thoroughly tested, this software should work in any standard C++ environment on any platform as long OpenCV is included, and its libraries are linked. Below we review a instructions to install and link to OpenCV for: </p>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="install__page.html#mac_sec">Mac OSX</a> </li>
<li><a class="el" href="install__page.html#windows_sec">Windows</a> </li>
<li><a class="el" href="install__page.html#linux_sec">Linux</a></li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="mac_sec">
Mac OSX</a></h3>
<p>There are two basic approaches to installing OpenCV in OS X: OpenCV Libraries, and OpenCV Framework. The Framework approach much simpler. Also, installation of OpenCV via MacPorts or Fink can be long, tedious, and error prone. Unless you have a reason to prefer the Libraries approach, the Framework approach is recommended.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="framework_sec">
OpenCV Framework</a></h4>
<p>Frameworks are OS X specific ways of bundling libraries. The OSX OpenCV Framework can be downloaded directly from the following url:</p>
<p><code><a href="http://www.ient.rwth-aachen.de/~asbach/OpenCV-Private-Framework-1.2.dmg">http://www.ient.rwth-aachen.de/~asbach/OpenCV-Private-Framework-1.2.dmg </a> </code></p>
<p>or it can be retrieved through the OSX RPM-style package manager YUM.</p>
<p>Inside the disk image is a directory, <code> OpenCV.framework </code> -- this should be copied to the /Library/Frameworks directory of your OS X install. This is a standard repository for frameworks and OS X knows to look for them there.</p>
<p>Once OpenCV is installed this way, uncomment the Makefile line:</p>
<p><code>PLATFORM=MACFRAMEWORK</code></p>
<p>and comment out the others:</p>
<p><code>#PLATFORM=MACPORTS<br/>
 #PLATFORM=CYGWIN<br/>
 #PLATFORM=LINUX</code></p>
<p>OpenCV is now installed and the Makefile is configured. You should be able to compile and run the NMPT library (<a class="el" href="install__page.html#install_sec">Installation</a>). NOTE: If you get to this point, and are unable build the code, (for example you get a terminal response like "-bash: make: command not found"), try installing Developer Tools and XCode, or updating your version of Developer tools and XCode. You can find these on your Mac OS Installation Disk that came with your computer, or you can download them online freely (signup required) from: <a href="http://developer.apple.com/technology/xcode.html">http://developer.apple.com/technology/xcode.html</a>.</p>
<h4><a class="anchor" id="macports_sec">
OpenCV Libraries</a></h4>
<p>The OpenCV Libraries can be installed via MacPorts (or fink). This installation method is long, tedious, and error prone, while the <a class="el" href="install__page.html#framework_sec">OpenCV Framework</a> approach is nearly instantaneous. If you have a good reason to install libraries via MacPorts Fink, read this section.</p>
<p>Once MacPorts has been installed, OpenCV can be installed using</p>
<p><code> &gt;&gt; sudo port install opencv </code></p>
<p>This will install the OpenCV header files to <code>/opt/local/include/opencv/</code>, and the library files to <code>/opt/local/lib/</code>.</p>
<p>By default, this installs dynamically linking libraries. To run any code that links to these libraries, the DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable must include the <code>/opt/local/lib/</code> directory. This can be set automatically whenever you open a Terminal by including the following line in your <code>~/.profile</code> configuration file:</p>
<p><code>export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/local/lib</code></p>
<p>NOTE: Some libraries in OpenCV seem to conflict with the Mac OS X libraries, and the latter should be given preference. This is done by using the DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH variable, rather than the standard DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH variable.</p>
<p>Once OpenCV is installed this way, uncomment the Makefile line:</p>
<p><code>PLATFORM=MACPORTS</code></p>
<p>and comment out the others:</p>
<p><code>#PLATFORM=MACFRAMEWORK<br/>
 #PLATFORM=CYGWIN<br/>
 #PLATFORM=LINUX</code></p>
<p>OpenCV is now installed and the Makefile is configured. You should be able to compile and run the NMPT library (<a class="el" href="install__page.html#install_sec">Installation</a>).</p>
<p>If you installed the OpenCV libraries via Fink rather than MacPorts, the libraries will be in /sw/lib, etc. You will need to make the following change to the Makefile:</p>
<p><code>ifeq ($(PLATFORM), MACPORTS)<br/>
 CC = g++<br/>
 OPENCV=/sw #This line used to read OPENCV=/opt/local<br/>
 CUSTOM_INCLUDES=-I${OPENCV}/include/opencv/ -I${SRC_DIR}<br/>
 endif</code></p>
<p>Also you will need to set your DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH accordingly:</p>
<p><code>export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH:/sw/local/lib</code></p>
<p>OpenCV is now installed and the Makefile is configured. You should be able to compile and run the NMPT library (<a class="el" href="install__page.html#install_sec">Installation</a>).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="windows_sec">
Windows</a></h3>
<p>The OpenCV libraries for Windows can be downloaded from SouceForge.net:</p>
<p><code><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=22870">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=22870 </a></code></p>
<p>By default, this installer installs the OpenCV headers and libraries to specific directories inside of the <code>"c:\Program/ Files\OpenCV"</code> directory.</p>
<p>Given that you keep this standard installation, then you can build the libraries included here from Cygwin. The Makefile is currently configured to use Cygwin's g++ compiler.</p>
<p>Once OpenCV is installed this way, uncomment the Makefile line:</p>
<p><code>PLATFORM=CYGWIN</code></p>
<p>and comment out the others:</p>
<p><code>#PLATFORM=MACPORTS<br/>
 #PLATFORM=MACFRAMEWORK<br/>
 #PLATFORM=LINUX</code></p>
<p>OpenCV is now installed and the Makefile is configured. You should be able to compile and run the NMPT library (<a class="el" href="install__page.html#install_sec">Installation</a>).</p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="linux_sec">
Linux</a></h3>
<p>The OpenCV libraries for Linux can be downloaded from SouceForge.net:</p>
<p><code><a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=22870">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=22870 </a></code></p>
<p>Unizip the tar file:</p>
<p><code> &gt;&gt;tar -xvf opencv-1.1pre1.tar.gz</code></p>
<p>In the newly created directory, build and install the OpenCV software:</p>
<p><code> &gt;&gt;./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install </code></p>
<p>By default this will install the OpenCV libraries to your /usr/local directory. Once OpenCV is installed this way, uncomment the Makefile line:</p>
<p><code>PLATFORM=LINUX</code></p>
<p>and comment out the others:</p>
<p><code>#PLATFORM=MACPORTS<br/>
 #PLATFORM=MACFRAMEWORK<br/>
 #PLATFORM=CYGWIN</code></p>
<p>OpenCV is now installed and the Makefile is configured. You should be able to compile and run the NMPT library (<a class="el" href="install__page.html#install_sec">Installation</a>). </p>
