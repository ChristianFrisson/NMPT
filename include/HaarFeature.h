	 * \brief Set the parameters that describe the Haar Wavelet used for 
	 * filtering. See detailed description of the parameters below.
	 *
	 * A haar wavelet is localized to a sub rectangle of the total filter
	 * area. There are 6 supported kinds of Haar wavelets: left-right, up-down, 
	 * center-surround, left-center-right, diagonal, up-center-down
	 *
	 * The HaarFeature parameter vector has 10 elements, which are: sub-region
	 * width, sub-region height, subregion x,y position of the center,
	 * kind (numbered 1-6 respective of the above), sign (describes which boxes
	 * are added and which are subtracted), horizontal symmetry, vertical 
	 * symmetry, mean subtraction, and brightness normalization.
	 *
	 * The center of an even-sized wavelet is to the right/bottom of the center. The
	 * center of an odd-sized wavelet is on the center.
	 *
	 * The last 4 parameters describe global behavior of the filtering process.
	 * They are: horizontal symmetry, vertical symmetry, mean subtraction,
	 * brightness normalization respectively. 
	 * 
	 * The first two each effectively
	 * double the number of boxes, by reflecting them around the horizontal and 
	 * vertical axes respectively. Values for these can be -1,0,+1. 0 means 
	 * no symmetry, -1 means the symmetric box has the opposite sign, and +1
	 * means the symmetric box has the same sign. 
	 * 
	 * Mean Subtraction means the mean pixel value of the image patch is 
	 * subtracted before filtering. This normalizes for contrast but not 
	 * brightness. Brightness Normalization divides the image patch by its L1 norm
	 * before filtering. If both options are set, brightness is normalized 
	 * and then the mean is subtracted. Both of these operations incur a time
	 * penalty, which is relatively small.
	 *
	 * Parameter value ranges: 
	 * \li 1) width: [1:patchWidth] -- [1:2]=2, (2:3]=3, (3:4]=4, ... 
	 * \li 2) height: [1:patchHeight] -- [1:2]=2, (2:3]=3, (3:4]=4, ... 
	 * \li 3) center-x: [0:(patchWidth-1)] -- [0:1]=0,  (1:2]=1, ..., (patchWith-2:patchWidth-1]=patchWidth-2
	 * \li 4) center-y: [0:(patchWidth-1)] -- [0:1]=0,  (1:2]=1, ..., (patchWith-2:patchWidth-1]=patchWidth-2
	 * \li 5) wavelet: [0:6] -- [0:1]=1, (1:2]=2, ...
	 * \li 6) sign: [0:2] -- [0:1]=-1, (1:2]=1
	 * \li 7) hSym: [0:3] -- [0:1]=-1, (1:2]=0, (2:3]=1
	 * \li 8) vSym: [0:3] -- [0:1]=-1, (1:2]=0, (2:3]=1
	 * \li 9) meanSub: [0:2] -- [0:1]=0, (1:2]=1
	 * \li 10) normBrigthness: [0:2] -- [0:1]=0, (1:2]=1
