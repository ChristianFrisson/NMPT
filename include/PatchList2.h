 * \brief <tt>Auxilliary Tool:</tt> A class that does the necessary book keeping
 * for filtering an image quickly at many scales. 
 *
 * Specifically, a PatchList gives BoxFeature, FeatureRegressor, and 
 * GentleBoostCascadedClassifier a way to apply a single weak learner to 
 * all remaining candidate object image patches. GentleBoost requires that
 * each weak learner output be accumulated with the output of other weak 
 * learners. PatchList maintains this accumulator. 
 *
 * They key parameters controlling a PatchList are the size of the image (using
 * setImage), the base patch size, and the scale increment factor. Here as
 * an example with an image of size 320x240, a base patch size of 30, and
 * a scale increment of 1.2. 
 *
 * At scale 0, the image is simply copied, and an integral image is computed. It
 * can be filtered in a region up to 29 pixels from the border by a filter of
 * size 30x30 (which is the base patch size). ImageSize represents the size
 * of this valid filtering region, which is 291x211 pixels and is useful for 
 * displaying an image representation of the fitlering output. Each of these
 * pixels contains the output of the filtering of one patch, so there are 
 * 61401 patches at scale 0.
 *
 * At scale 1, the size of patches to search increases by a factor of 1.2, 
 * giving a patchWidth of 36. Internally, the image is downscaled by a factor
 * of 1.2, giving a 266x200 image, with a 237x171 valid filtering region, and
 * 40527 total patches.
 *
 * At scale 12, the patch size would be 30*(1.2^12)=267x267. This is larger than
 * the height of the image, and so the largest scale is 11. Since the scales
 * start at 0, there are 12 total scales: 
 *
 * The PatchList has 12 scales containing 170925 total patches.
 * \li Scale 0: PatchSize - 30x30; FilterSize - 30x30; ImageSize - 291x211; Patches - 61401
 * \li Scale 1: PatchSize - 36x36; FilterSize - 30x30; ImageSize - 237x171; Patches - 40527
 * \li Scale 2: PatchSize - 43x43; FilterSize - 30x30; ImageSize - 193x137; Patches - 26441
 * \li Scale 3: PatchSize - 51x51; FilterSize - 30x30; ImageSize - 156x109; Patches - 17004
 * \li Scale 4: PatchSize - 62x62; FilterSize - 30x30; ImageSize - 125x86; Patches - 10750
 * \li Scale 5: PatchSize - 74x74; FilterSize - 30x30; ImageSize - 99x67; Patches - 6633
 * \li Scale 6: PatchSize - 89x89; FilterSize - 30x30; ImageSize - 78x51; Patches - 3978
 * \li Scale 7: PatchSize - 107x107; FilterSize - 30x30; ImageSize - 60x37; Patches - 2220
 * \li Scale 8: PatchSize - 128x128; FilterSize - 30x30; ImageSize - 45x26; Patches - 1170
 * \li Scale 9: PatchSize - 154x154; FilterSize - 30x30; ImageSize - 33x17; Patches - 561
 * \li Scale 10: PatchSize - 185x185; FilterSize - 30x30; ImageSize - 22x9; Patches - 198
 * \li Scale 11: PatchSize - 222x222; FilterSize - 30x30; ImageSize - 14x3; Patches - 42
 *
 * Other parameters that can be set are maxSize, minSize, and stepWidth. MaxSize
 * changes the maximum searched patch size. If (0,0), then the smaller image
 * dimension is used. MinSize changes the minimum searched patch size. If (0,0),
 * the base patch size is used. Otherwise, the image is scaled in size by 
 * a factor of basePatchSize/minSize before searching. StepWidth reduces the 
 * number of patches searched by skipping rows and columns. If StepWidth is 1,
 * each patch location is searched. If it is 2, every other one is searched. If
 * it is 2/3, then two consecutive patches are searched and one is skipped.
 * 
 * PatchList is effecicient about not doing more memory allocation than it 
 * needs. A rule of thumb is that giving a PatchList images of different sizes
 * will incur a slowdown, but if all images are the same size, then subsequent
 * calls to setImage will be faster. 
 *
 * For example, a typical time for the first call to setImage with a 320x240 
 * image, a base patch size of 30x30, and a scale increment of 1.2 is 15 ms,
 * while subsequent calls with the same image size and parameters takes 1.5 ms.
